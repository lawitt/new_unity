# Unity_project_2023

## Description
We have coded a jump game with 3 levels. The player is a fox who initially has 3 lives. As the fox finds its way through the forest (later on the field) by jumping from platform to platform. Some of these platfroms move from side to side, so he has to decide for the right moment to jump on them. On his way he encounters different enemies. The enemies are eagles, tractors and rifles which he has to dodge from or fight against by shooting his bullets at them. When the player anyway collides with one of the enimies he looses one of his lives. If the lives are at 0 the game is over. There is also the option to collect a protective shield which protects the player from loosing lives when colliding with enimies. Furthermore the fox can eat a bird which increases his lives by one. To reach the next level a chest must be collected which is located on the highest platform of each level. The final reward for the fox is to be reunited with his vixen.

## How to Play
The fox can be moved to the left and right by pressing the respective arrows. Furthermore bullets can be fired pressing the key 'X'.
